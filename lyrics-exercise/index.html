        <h1> Afterglow </h1>
        <h2> by Taylor Swift</h2> 
    <p> 
        <br> I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
        <br> Put you in jail for something you didn't do
        <br> I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
        <br> Thought I had reason to attack, but no
        <br> Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
        <br> Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
        <br> Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
        <br> It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

    </p>
    <p> Hey
        <br> It's all me in my head
        <br> I'm the one who burned us down
        <br> But it's not what I meant
        <br> Sorry that I hurt you
        <br> I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you
        <br> I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
        <br> I need to say, hey
        <br> It's all me, just don't go
        <br> Meet me in the afterglow
    </p>
    <p>
        <br> It's so excruciating to see you low
        <br> Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
        <br>  This ultraviolet morning light below
        <br>  Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh
        <br>  I lived like an island, punished you with silence
        <br>  Went off like sirens, just crying
        <br>  Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
        <br>  It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say   
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>  Hey
        <br> It's all me in my head
        <br>  I'm the one who burned us down
        <br>   But it's not what I meant
        <br>  I'm sorry that I hurt you
        <br> I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you
        <br>  I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
        <br>  I need to say, hey
        <br>  It's all me, just don't go
        <br>  Meet me in the afterglow
    <p> Tell me that you're still mine
        <br>  Tell me that we'll be just fine
        <br>  Even when I lose my mind
        <br>  I need to say
        <br>  Tell me that it's not my fault
        <br>  Tell me that I'm all you want
        <br> Even when I break your heart 
    </p>

        <br> I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
