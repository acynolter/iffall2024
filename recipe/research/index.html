        <h1> Piskota, Genoise, Sponge Cake</h1>
        <h2> Author : Kathy from Inspired Cuisine </h2>
        <p> This is arguably the simplest of all cake recipes, 6 eggs, 6 tablespoons of flour and 6 tablespoons of sugar. From here, make a cake roll, a round cake, a square cake, a multi layered cake and fill with your choice of butter cream for a grand presentation! </p>

            <br> Total Time: 45 minutes

        <p> Tip : You can as easily make a layered cake, if using a cookie sheet, just cut the cake in two lengthwise and spread one half with butter cream. You could also bake two or more round cake forms, and again spread each layer with butter cream. You could also cut each layer in two and therefore create more layers with butter cream on each layer, then decorate the top and sides of the cake with more butter cream. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients  </h3>
        <p> <br>6 eggs separated

        <li> Separate eggs from yolks. </li>
        <li> Using a stand mixer, beat egg yolks, adding sugar a tablespoonful at a time until the egg/sugar mixture forms a ribbon and is a light yellow in color. </li>
        <li> Continue beating, add vanilla and flour, one tablespoon full at a time.</li>
        <li> Whip egg whites in a separate bowl until stiff.</li>

        <br> In this part of their website the background image is responsive to your cursor as you move around which makes it more interactives. I like how there isn't so much content that you feel overwhelmed by it. And also that there is a large scroll menu that lines up with the same element on the page.
        </p>
        <p>Simple Complex: <a href="https://simplecomplex.com/"> Personalized Nutrition</a><br> This site shows a god overview of what it is about wiht a constantly scrolling menu at the top and a large video that adds visuals to their brand identity. If you scroll down, they have a horizontal array which allows them to incorporate lots of images and text in a space efficient way which coud be good for a recipe.

        <br> I really like how text boxes pop up when you click visuals. This could be useful in a recipe website by showing how to do the steps and once you click on the photo you are able to get more instruction.
